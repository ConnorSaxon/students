## Background

I am currently a sophmore double majoring in computer science and math. I work at the Vol Study Center, the Math Place, and recently finished TAing for a Winter mini term Math 125 class. I am currently participating in Tau Beta Pi the engineering honor society for which I volunteer as the Engineers Day Co-chair.

## Interests

I am interested in studying scientific computing since it ties together both of my majors quite well and a lot of the scientific computing classes count for both math and computer science.
